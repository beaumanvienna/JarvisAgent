# Development
<br>
To clone the project, use<br>

`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/beaumanvienna/jarvis`<br>
<br>
Jarvis is cross-platform. The project is defined in a Lua file for permake5.<br>
<br>
Run <br>
`premake5 gmake` to get a Makefile<br>
`premake5 vs2022` to get a VS solution<br>
`premake5 xcode4` for Xcode on MacOS<br>
<br>
If you created a Makefile, build the project with<br>
`make config=release verbose=1 && make config=debug verbose=1`<br>
<br>
Run the executable with<br>
`./bin/Release/jarvis` or `./bin/Debug/jarvis`<br>
<br>
To update the source code, use<br>
`git pull && git submodule update --init --recursive`<br>
<br>
Use `premake5 clean` to clean the project from build artifacts.<br>

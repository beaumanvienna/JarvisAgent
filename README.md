# JarvisAgent

<br>

JarvisAgent is a **C++ console application** that operates as a background service (‚Äúagent‚Äù) for automated AI-assisted file processing.  
It monitors a queue folder for prompt and instruction files, sends them to an AI provider through a REST API, and stores the results in an output directory.

It can perform AI-driven tasks and serve as a component for workflow automation.

## Layer Overview

| Layer | Responsibility | Status |
|-------|----------------|--------|
| **Engine** | Networking (`libcurl`), logging (`spdlog`), JSON parsing (`simdjson`), threading (`BS thread-pool`), profiling (`tracy`) | ‚úÖ |
| **Event System** | Thread-safe atomic event queue and dispatcher for cross-thread communication | ‚úÖ |
| **Application** | Orchestrates queue handling, event dispatching, file tracking, and AI query flow | ‚úÖ |
| **Config** | `config.json` with folder paths, thread count, AI backend model, and other settings | ‚úÖ |
| **I/O** | File watcher, categorizer, and environment assembly (STNG/CNXT/TASK) | ‚úÖ |
| **Networking** | Asynchronous AI query dispatch (HTTP REST via libcurl) | ‚úÖ |

---

## File Categories

JarvisAgent processes different types of prompt files located in the queue folder defined in the configuration file `config.json`.  
Each file category serves a specific purpose, and files are identified using 4-letter, all-caps prefixes.

| Category | Description | Prefix | Example Filename |
|-----------|-------------|---------|------------------|
| **Settings** | Style, behavior, or tone modifiers (e.g., ‚Äúwrite succinct‚Äù, ‚Äúuse formal tone‚Äù) | `STNG` | `STNG_write_succinct.txt` |
| **Context / Description** | Provides contextual or background information for AI prompts | `CNXT` | `CNXT_project_overview.txt` |
| **Task** | Defines the main task or instruction for the AI | `TASK` | `TASK_compare_requirements.txt` |
| **Subfolders** | Contain additional prompt or requirement files, processed recursively | *(folder name itself)* | `../queue/subproject/` |
| **Requirements** | Requirement files such as customer or system requirements | *(no prefix)* | `REQ_vehicle_speed.txt` or `customer_requirement_001.txt` |

üß† Categories **STNG**, **CNXT**, and **TASK** are combined into an **environment** used alongside each individual requirement file during processing.

## Architecture & Design Overview

- **Environment Files** ‚Äî Files in categories STNG (Settings), CNXT (Context/Description), and TASK (Tasks). These form the shared environment or knowledge base.  
- **Query Files (Requirement Files)** ‚Äî Each represents a smaller task or requirement that is processed using the shared environment.  
- **File Watcher** ‚Äî Monitors additions, modifications, and removals in the queue folder (including environment and query files).  
- **File Categorizer & Tracker** ‚Äî Tracks which files belong to which category, monitors modification status, and provides content retrieval.  
- **CurlWrapper / REST Interface** ‚Äî Handles communication with the AI provider‚Äôs API (e.g., GPT-4/5) via HTTP.  
- **Thread Pool / Parallel Processing** ‚Äî Configured by `maxThreads` in `config.json`; handles multiple query tasks in parallel.  
- **JarvisAgent Application** ‚Äî Orchestrates startup, event handling, file watching, categorization, and query dispatching.  
- **Core Engine** ‚Äî Provides globally shared components (thread pool, event queue, logger, config, etc.).

## State Machine & Processing Flow

JarvisAgent operates as a **reactive state machine** that responds to file changes:

1. **CompilingEnvironment** ‚Äî Waits until all STNG, CNXT, and TASK files are available and up to date.  
2. **SendingQueries** ‚Äî Dispatches requirement (REQ) files in parallel using the assembled environment.  
3. **AllQueriesSent** ‚Äî Awaits completion of all query futures.  
4. **AllResponsesReceived** ‚Äî Returns to idle until environment or requirements change.

Any detected file modification automatically triggers selective reprocessing:
- Environment changes ‚áí full environment rebuild.  
- Requirement changes ‚áí re-query for that specific file only.

---

## How It Works

1. **Startup** ‚Äî Initializes the core systems and begins watching the configured queue directory.  
2. **File Monitoring** ‚Äî The FileWatcher detects file additions, modifications, and deletions in real time.  
3. **Categorization** ‚Äî Each file is categorized as STNG, CNXT, TASK, REQ, or Subfolder.  
4. **Environment Assembly** ‚Äî STNG, CNXT, and TASK files are merged into a single environment context.  
5. **Query Dispatch** ‚Äî Each REQ file is processed by combining it with the current environment and sent asynchronously to the AI backend.  
6. **Result Storage** ‚Äî Responses are written to the output directory.  
7. **Reactivity** ‚Äî Any file change automatically restarts the relevant part of the pipeline.

## Design Highlights

- **Event-driven architecture** ‚Äî Loosely coupled, non-blocking design.  
- **Atomic dirty tracking** ‚Äî Modified files are tracked precisely without redundant work.  
- **Parallel querying** ‚Äî Uses thread pool for concurrent AI requests.  
- **Automatic dependency tracking** ‚Äî Rebuilds only what changed.  
- **Hot reload** ‚Äî Any file change triggers instant reprocessing.  
- **Cross-platform** ‚Äî Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

# Introduction
<br>
Jarvis can perform AI tasks. It can be used to automate workflows. <br>
<br>
Jarvis is a console application that operates as a background service. It monitors a queue folder for prompt and instruction files, sends them to an AI provider through a REST API, and stores the results in an output directory. <br>
<br>

| **Engine** | Networking (`libcurl`), logging (`spdlog`), JSON parsing (`simdjson`), threading | ðŸš§ |
| **Application** | Orchestrates queue handling and task flow | ðŸš§ |
| **Config** | `config.json` with folder paths + thread count | âœ… |
| **I/O** | Input queue, output folder | ðŸš§ |
| **Networking** | ChatGPT requests/responses | ðŸš§ |

<br>
If you created a Makefile, build the project with<br>
`make config=release verbose=1 && make config=debug verbose=1`<br>
<br>
Run the executable with<br>
`./bin/Release/jarvis` or `./bin/Debug/jarvis`<br>
<br>
To update the source code, use<br>
`git pull && git submodule update --init --recursive`<br>
